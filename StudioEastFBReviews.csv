January 14,"can't believe it took me so long to get to this place. great atmosphere and the food is delish. nice choice of beers. caesar was good, too. loved the fries!",
"October 29, 2017","My sister and I brought my mom tonight (Sunday) and enjoyed happy hour wine and the AMAZING sounds of guitar player Mark. Topped with our gracious server Jesse, he and Mark made the atmosphere that much better. We ate ALL the apps and loved every one. Can't wait to come back. Please bring Mark back he's exactly what a restaurant wants for soft yet upbeat music!!!",
"October 23, 2017",We went there sunday night with our toddler. Food and ambiance was great! Our baby loved her ramen. And a special shoutout to our server that night who did an awesome job! His name is JESSE. We can say that he really likes what he is doing and knowledgable about the menu. He even gave my daughter her own bowl and chopsticks for beginners.,
"September 10, 2017",I've wanted to eat at Studio East for a long time and it did not disappoint. Food was amazing. Had the Pad Thai Chicken Wings (my husband said the best wings he's ever had and I agree) and Calamari Pakora. Delicious!!! And for dessert the homemade ice cream trio was outstanding. Service was excellent. Servers were fun and friendly and knew the food and drinks menu. We are definitely going back for Tuesday rib night even though we live 200km away!!,
January 26,There is always an excellent menu and cocktail selection - not to mention the service! Spot on!,
"July 14, 2017","Took hubby for the first time tonight , and he didn't know what to order, he said the menu looked too good. Food was awesome, as always; service genuine and prompt. I like when a server takes the time to talk to you and just check in, when you don't have a mouth full. ÔøΩ .... as always 5* ... thanks Ray Bear and Saronn Pov . ÔøΩ",
"November 24, 2017",Best burger I‚Äôve had in a really long time. Might just be the best burger I‚Äôve ever had!,
"May 28, 2017","I've been here twice now and the food was quite good both times. However, I found the menu to be overpriced for what you get and was especially appalled to see that I had been charged $7 for a mocktail that was ordered during happy hour in which my fellow diners were charged $5 for their beer and wine.  Overall I am very dissatisfied and probably won't be going back any time soon.  At least not until I'm not pregnant and can order one of those $5 glasses of wine instead of a $7 glass of ginger beer with a cucumber and lime wedge stuck on the side.",
"August 26, 2017","The best food I've had at a restaurant in a very long time! I had the curry fish ramen bowl. Great service and atmosphere, too. Thank you!",
"November 30, 2017","The atmosphere was so fun and vibrant, the ramen was absolutely amazing, and the staff were very friendly. Definitely coming back next time I'm in the city.",
"January 27, 2017","To say the ramen here is excellent is an incredible understatement. It's more like an incredible flavor-playground: so many complimentary flavors swirling around it's borderline intoxicating. I also highly recommend the ribs which are melt-in-your-mouth delicious, stacked high with an refreshing slaw (there's a rib night on Tuesday I believe?). Many of the appetizers are also fun and tasty and reasonably priced if you're trying to do a tapas style dinner. The staff are very... friendly and courteous and informed me on my last visit that they were beginning to do brunch on the weekends (which I have yet to check out). Definitely one of my favorites in the city.",
"February 11, 2017","First visit, table of four and no reservation. It did not disappoint. I had the steak and it was cooked to perfection... melt in your mouth! Yam fries were large,  tastey and plentiful.  Tim, our waiter, was very professional, courteous and had no problems explaining menu selections. A great asset to this establishment. Our table was looked after all night and thought it was nice for the chef to ask how are dining was. Nice personal touch. We learned about the brunch offering on wknds. I can only imagine it will fall in line with the dinner menu. SUPERB! Until next time...:)",
"December 7, 2017",I love this place especially the ramen ÔøΩ just ÔøΩ,
"November 27, 2015","Really pleased to see this place open in our neighbourhood. I have been four times already. Best meal so far was the ramen bowl full of very succulent pork. Main thing for me is the atmosphere and local vibe. I have to say though, that the loud pop music is a real detraction. Last time there we could not hold a conversation without shouting and the music itself ...being some sort of electronic dance pop seemed out of place, especially if they are trying to create a nice intimate neighbourhood feeling. It is so much more enjoyable to be able to appreciate food and conversation together.",
"February 21, 2016","I am a guy so I love wings!!! I am a pilot so have had tried wings in many cities around the world. The wings here are the best I have had. I don't really know what they did to them but it will bring me back. Num pang Cambodian sandwich is something I would eat every week. The city needs more unique gems like this!! The owner kindly gave us warm sushi on the house (warm sushi!, I know. I wouldn't order that). It was amazing! There are many spots in the city that serve beer and pub food (we have been to most). Usually we go to places and go back because of the atmosphere, not the food. There was live music on Sunday (Paul Lamb) and great food. Owners were great to engage with and service was very friendly. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",
"March 6, 2016","First visit today. Off the bat I need to say the breakfast burger was delicious, but the price is high for what you get. The service was lacking.  We heard the steam buns we good but we don't know because 2 hours after opening they were sold out. Don't get the coffee! My wife ordered a chi latte and I got the latte. Tasted like instant coffee and cost $5.00. Not sure if we'll return. Burger, potato side and 2 coffees came to $30.00 before any tip. Underwhelming",
"December 7, 2015","Saronn and Ray - thank you so much for the incredible Holiday party tonight that you helped us host for Gold Recruitment Services. Our guests were blown away by the incredible atmosphere, amazing food and drink (lemon drop martinis are genius!) and the welcoming, professional and caring service from your team. I'm sure they will all come back for some more wonderful times with you, and I would absolutely recommend your establishment as a perfect place for any corporate event! Thanks for making ours so memorable.. Kath Perry",
"February 23, 2017","Great neighborhood spot to unwind after work. The food is different than any other spot in town and in a good way. Try the ribs on Tuesday, the daily curry bowls or for weekend Brunch, the Fish & Chips. Nothing will disappoint.",
"January 22, 2017","I ate there for the first time last night, and it was amazing! I had the bowl of lighty-curried broth and ramen noodles, with perfectly battered haddock, egg, mushrooms, and a few other veggies. It was outstanding! The service was excellent, too.",
"September 9, 2017",Friendly staff and great atmosphere. Must try the sushi tacos!!!,
"March 6, 2016","I attended this restaurant for my first time last Thursday. I was blown away by the staff and owners, each one of them stopped by our table to chat and see how we were enjoying the experience. The food was so full of flavour! I was delighted. I will be back!",
"June 6, 2016","This place is amazing!! I had the warm sushi, lamb sticks and fermented Ribs dinner and it changed my world. Best meal out I've had in months. Service was fantastic and I'll be back again and again.",
"December 7, 2015","Went to Studio East last night and had a fantastic time. Two of us had the Ramen and another enjoyed the warm sushi and we all thought it was great. The atmosphere was awesome, with live music and our server was very pleasant. Definitely will be revisiting!",
"May 8, 2016","I loved this place so much. I got ramen and it was extremely amazing and full of so much flavour. The wait staff were excellent and friendly! The food came in a good amount of time. The place itself was unique and the vibe was outstanding. At the end of our meals, Saronn came by and made sure we were satisfied with the meal! She's a sweet person and needless to say I am definitely coming back here. It is now my (only)favourite place to eat in Halifax :)",
"November 6, 2015","My husband and I ate at Studio East for the first time last night, and it was STELLAR. I can't say enough about the food (every bite was delicious!) but we also loved the atmosphere and the service. My prediction is that this place is going to be crowded with Haligonians who want to ""regulars"".  Congratulations Ray and Saronn !",
"May 10, 2017","Not sure why we haven't come here yet. I want those two years of my life back. Unbelievable flavours, huge portions, funky atmosphere and wonderful service. We will be back. Hopefully soon.",
