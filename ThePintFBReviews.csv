"November 3, 2017","Congratulations, great opening night. All of these happy familiar faces, this place is full of life and great vibes!",
January 18,"Our favourite spot to grab lunch or dinner, have some drinks while watching any game we want. The Pint is in a great location, and has friendly staff that serve up food quickly from a great pub menu with reasonable prices. I highly recommend wing night! You won't be disappointed!",
February 2,"Still want tio try other things on the menu to see, but based on my visit, it's good so far. The place was super busy so because of that, speed of service suffered a little. Wings were tasty, and there's a decent sauce selection. I only wish there were sauce descriptions.",
"December 17, 2017","This year I worked as a senior cook here for 5 months. The new management since April/2017 has run the Argyle into the ground and I, as well as a few former employees and many, many regulars, are sad to see it fail so hard that they had to change their name?! I mean the Argyle has been around for 26 years. Now the focus is on alcohol and girls, but they are trying to run a kitchen as well! The food has turned to crap as none of the managers have ever run a restaurant before. ...Truly a shame. Unless you want to ""get lit"" and grind with drunk people at night of course! This being said, I have NO idea how they are still making profit. Plenty of other cheap, generic places to drink in Halifax. Nothing special about the Argyle (or the Pint Mansion or whatever) anymore.",
March 4 at 8:39pm,"Nice place, great atmosphere. The drinks and food was awesome especially the peppered peach cocktail & taziki wrap! Only thing that really bothered me was the woman's washroom was super dirty.... Wads of tp all over the floor, NO tp in 2 stalls (had to grab paper towel).",
"November 29, 2017","I went to The Pint for the first time tonight and I must say I was impressed. The wings where great, the beer was cold and the staff was amazing (thanks Caleigh)...the live entertainment was also top notch...I think I found my new spot!",
"November 6, 2017",Great atmosphere! The place looks fantastic with the bar in the centre and TV's and pics all on the walls. Staff friendly and very attentive. Food was delicious.  Reasonably priced and good variety of beers. We are looking forward to going back again.,

"August 10, 2017","I went to the Argyle last night for some drinks with friends, I had a whale of a time....Normally I get made fun of for drinking only soda water but my lovely servers, Lindsay and Brady were both kind and understand of my odd drink of choice, soda water.....I highly recommed this establishment to anyone who enjoys a good drink and great atmosphere.",
