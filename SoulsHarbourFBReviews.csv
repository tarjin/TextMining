"November 5, 2017","By far the most thankful, humble  place to bring your gently used items. You know your gifts are given away to someone who needs them. The food they serve here is top notch and the volunteers genuinely care about each and everyone they serve. Highly recommend if you would like to get involved, Please check out Souls Harbour. Highly respect what they are doing.",
