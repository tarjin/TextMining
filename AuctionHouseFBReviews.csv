January 20,"I am now a regular.  And by regular, I mean I'm there at least once a week, often more, and it's consistently a highlight. The staff are wonderful. The food is wonderful.  The drinks are wonderful.  The live music is wonderful. I've held several events there with numbers up to about 20.  I've brought colleagues, clients, my wife and family and it's always been wonderful no matter the context.  Whether casual, romantic, or professional it's always wonderful. There are no bad choices when it comes to this place except the choice not to go.",
February 24,The food is great and so are the brews on tap (we love that Upstreet was served this weekend - really good idea). Atmosphere is lovely: A variety of seating - we‚Äôve sat in a different spot each time. Today we tried the brunch for the first time - also amazing AND amazing service.  Thank you so much for a great start to our day.  :) We‚Äôll be back again soon.,
January 23,So we came about 5:30 for wings on Mon Jan 22. Celebrating a job change. Brought the kids. Wish I could remember our server‚Äôs name becaus he was awesome.  Caught on to fam banter that dad got  a lime in his propeller ginger beer and he wanted one. Never said a thing to server. Yet he brought a glass with limes quickly and said ‚Äú limes for all!‚Äù  And was awesome all evening.,
March 1,"Loved the atmosphere at the Auction House! Our family of five all thoroughly enjoyed our meals, beautifully prepared and delicious! This will be our go to restaurant whenever we are attending anything at the Scotia Back Center, it's literally just around the corner. The staff were the crown & glory of this little gem.",
"December 23, 2017","Great spot for quality pub food with an awesome beer selection. Shared some tasty appetizers and I had a great burger. The servers are all super friendly and attentive, our guy (I think his name was Sam) made some good recommendations and was quick to get us whatever we needed.",
"November 18, 2017","Thank you so much for our gift certificate!  We had such a wonderful time last night, the food was just amazing.  Great atmosphere and the service was incredible.  We will be coming back lots to work our way through your menu!  To top it off it was our 8th year of being in Canada yesterday so it was a great way to celebrate.  Thank again!!!",
"September 30, 2017","We have been to the auction house twice and have had an awesome experience both times. The first time it was extremely busy but we still felt as though we were waited on hand and foot. The second time, they were super accommodating when trying to find us a spot that was a little quieter so that I could enjoy my dining experience more (I have hearing loss that can make it difficult for me to have conversation with my partner in a noisy restaurant). To top it off, the food is incredible and we are always pleasantly surprised at the low price on our bill, even with having some drinks!",
"October 29, 2017","Our group started as 5 and expanded to 8 family and friends. Our reservation request was met with a great table space in the front window.  The service was prompt and attentive. The food was great. I had the ""BFFFT"" and I was not disappointed! I would recommend this spot for brunch, but make a reservation because by the time we left the place was full and there was a line up.  This was my first time but definitely won't be the last.",
"November 19, 2017",Great service. The staff are excellent. Fantastic food and excellent selection of craft beer and good wine list. Great for a romantic date night to a get together with friends. Good live music.,
"October 30, 2017",Been twice since moving back home and the food and staff are top notch - and the hi-light is the live music - Skin and Jones will keep us coming back regularly!,
February 18,"Tried The Auction House our for the first time on Friday night before the Moosehead game. Our server Callum was terrific and her recommendations did not disappoint. The Oat Burger was amazing, cannot wait to try it again. You will not be disappointed üòäüòä",
February 7,"I worked here, was assaulted by a coworker, Alex Batanov, in the upstairs kitchen, then Grafton Conner went out of it's way to cover the incident up, they are lying on my workmens comp forms, claiming they paid me less than they did, that the incident wasn't reported, and that it never happened. Not cool, Grafton Conner.",
January 17,"The food was delicious, the beer great and our waitress was very helpful with her suggestions ( she was right).",
February 14,"It was an awesome experience! Atmosphere, food, service by Steve was definitely 5 star. Our first but not last visit for sure",
"November 5, 2017","Delicious!! Literally the best food, nachos were top notch! Waitress was friendly and fast! Will be back :)",
January 27,The wings are awesome and cheap on Mondays and Thursdays. ($4.50 for 10) Had a great time both night I went there.,
February 20,Service was good but fish and chips very oily. Vegatarian burger was good.,
"November 18, 2017","Our table is enjoying a visit with some out of town friends.  Thanks for the exceptional hospitality, atmosphere and entertainment. Cheers to Matt!",
"October 15, 2017",First time ever there & the food/beer was excellent! Great service & entertainment! Cant wait to go back next time I am in Halifax!ÔøΩÔøΩ,
"May 25, 2017","I know it was a busy night, as there was a concert at ScotiaBank Center, but it wasn't just the fact that our food was painfully slow to arrive, it was: - the fact that our waitress never acknowledged the kitchen would take over an hour to prepare our food or even came to reassure us they were doing their best to get the food out - the waitress did not come back to check on drinks for very long periods of time (house lost money on potential drinks bought) - white wine served ...room temperature- twice! - a plate of nachos was mistakenly put in front of one member of our party and after she had a bite it was discovered that plate was meant for another person so the waitress took it back and gave it to the other person! Luckily enough we are all friends so it did not offend us... much I will say they gave our party 20% off our bill for waiting so long, but that is not enough for me to go back or recommend you go.",
March 18 at 12:10pm,"Amazing food, atmosphere and service. It‚Äôs one of my favourite places in town. Highly recommended",
"October 8, 2017","5 Stars! Great entertainment, intimate setting, best servers downtown, great food and wine. Wouldn't go anywhere else.üëå",

"March 20, 2017","Went to the auction house on the weekend with a large group.  Service was fantastic! Our waitress was super amazing, I wish I could remember her name.  I had the southern chicken sandwich and it was probably the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. I was pleasantly surprised.  This was my third time st the auction house and I've had a great experience every time.",
"February 21, 2017","Been there many times and always enjoy it. Different vibe than most places in the city. Service is good, lots of beer options and food is very good. Got the retro burger so special last weekend. It comes with fries and a beer for $12, one of the best deals in town and a really good burger to boot!",
"June 13, 2017",Beautiful day on the only patio on Argyle Street. Quick service with delicious $2.50 Caesars! Brunch was delicious - love the Down &Dirty chicken and waffles . Definitely would recommend this for summer brunch,
"May 13, 2017","It was busy because of the nearby comedy show but the manager at the door Friday evening was great! We got drinks then shortly after we got seats near the bar and ordered food! The food was amazing, service amazing! 5 star from miramichi'ers visiting! Looking forward to our next visit this summer!",
"July 24, 2017",The food there was delicious and perfect portions. We also ordered an appetizer which I usually regret because of the amount of food but it was the perfect amount and also tasty. We will definitely be coming back!,
"August 1, 2017","The beer was nice, the food ok and the service ok. I've had better. There's plenty of other places to go to in the area, so it's not like your stuck for choice.",
"March 26, 2017",We dropped by to try your Burger for Burger Week and it was the best so far and have recommended it all our friends.  Great service and atmosphere. Will be back again to try other things on the menue,
"February 24, 2017","Just ate here with some family and friends for my cousins birthday. We had recently lost someone very near and dear to us and the team at the Auction House was so good to us. I don't usually write reviews but they went above and beyond. Food was excellent along with the service, atmosphere and entertainment. Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking for a good time. Will be going back very soon in the near future",
"May 26, 2017",Food was excellent... Had the truffle fries and the beef dip. The fries were to die for. The beef dip was good but had gravy not au jus as listed on the menu. The Caesars were excellent... Will definitely be back!!! ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ,

"January 18, 2017","We recently dined at the Auction House for the first time.....will I go back? Without a doubt! The food was fabulous, but the waitress was really what made this experience a great one. Thank you Ashley!! You were genuine, caring and more importantly interested in us! This experience was no 'Hi can I take your order'....this was great... conversation with a smiling face, getting to know us, and simply happy to have us there. All pubs/restaurants serve a food product.....not all can make it a great experience! Thank you again Ashley....hope you get on that Caribbean trip soon...your hard work at university and at the Auction House warrant that rest and relaxation!",
"January 18, 2017","Went to the Auction house for brunch this Sunday past and had an excellent experience. The staff and manager were very attentive and service was friendly and speedy. The menu was varied and my meal, The Porker, was delicious! The best part of brunch for me was the desert table ($5 for everything!). Peanut butter cheesecake balls and banana cupcakes were a major highlight. Will definitely be going again!",
"January 17, 2017","Our party of four enjoyed the new brunch menu on January 8th. Something for everyone . The Benny East Coaster with eggs benny (sriracha worked well here)served on a halibut fish cakes were scrumptious. The Steppie P featured a veg omelette w dragons breath cheese and a fresh beautifully presented salad. And if you're truly peckish, dive into the down and durty-delicious and more than a match for a hearty app! Service was prompt and attentive; good crowd for Sunday noon - pleasant and hungry. Highly recommend return visit for brunch- much for your palate to explore, and a great value!",
"January 16, 2017",Went  to the Auction House a couple of months ago for the first time for drinks and ended up ordering a meal because everything sounded amazing. The food and drinks came a lot quicker than I expected seeing as it was super busy. A couple weeks ago I decided to go back on a Saturday for brunch and have been craving their brunch ever since! The food is always amazing and the service even better. Would highly recommend!!,
"January 16, 2017","Perfect vibe and feel of a place for a post conference bite to eat and great beer or 4. Service was amazing, Friday evening a group of 8 colleagues all from out of Province enjoyed professional environment and prompt service!! Food was great, authentic east coast flare with many fan favourites as well. Highlight was the buzz during a few actual ""live auctions"" of a Brunch for 2 and a desert, raising money for a local charity, great job!! Will be back again for sure and I know my colleagues will be in Ontario talking about their exceptional experience and the NS craft beer!! See ya soon!!",
"January 16, 2017","Had the pleasure of eating at the Auction House with my family. We were totally impressed with the setting, the service was second to none and the food was awesome. We have recommended it to everyone we know and will definitely be back!! ÔøΩ",
"January 16, 2017",The best wings in HRM at the time of this post. Tuesday and Thursday wing nights just .35 a wing.,
"January 16, 2017","Went for supper before the Halifax Mooseheads game this past Friday. Arrived at 5:15pm, ordered drinks while waiting for our forth person. The came before 5:30. Waitress came back to take our orders at 5:50, also asked the forth person if he wanted a drink. At 6:20 the waitress came back to ask if we were doing alright, still didn't bring him a drink. At 6:40 waitress came back to our table to say our food would be another 10 minutes or less, we asked more like five and she s...aid, likely more than 10. As the game started at 7, we opted to pay for drinks and leave without having supper. The waitress did comp the drinks, but we ended up sitting for over and hour and half, never having food. Definitely won't be back, horrible service and hardly ever came around. Wouldn't waste time if I had somewhere to be after supper, which sucks because the food is always good. Won't be going back now.",
"November 3, 2016","We went for the first time November 2nd. The atmosphere is nice, and the decor is on point. But it went down from there. Service was painfully slow. Our group of 4 got our drinks a different times after waiting a while. We got the pretzels for an appetizer and it came with a main after we requested that we get the appetizer first. The food had potential. However with this visit, it was almost like the food sat on the pass losing heat. The burger was good. The fries tasted lik...e it was cooked in old oil. Overall. The service was slow and felt ignored by the servers, the food was just okay. I would never reject to option of going again, but I don't think it will be my first choice. Maybe it was just an off evening.",
"October 31, 2016","We were here for a birthday party. We tried 6 of the appetizers because we're crazy and they were all delicious.  Spencer was our server, he went out of his way to make our night great. Thanks Spencer . Great time",
"October 23, 2016",Recently had brunch here- Great value- good prices on the food and drinks for $2.50 ! Everyone at our table was very pleased with their choices. The new menu has wonderful local offerings. My favorite is the Dragon Breath and caramelized onion omelette- cooked to perfection and served with a tasty salad. There are lots of options for the hungry dinar as well- the pulled pork grilled cheese or the maritime fishcakes- or the Hangover special.... Then a really nice touch is the $5 dessert table with lots of delicious freshly baked treats- such as divine cupcakes or peanut butter chocolate truffles. The service is great and it is so nice that you can have a quiet corner or sit in the front - there is room to do whatever pleases you- I recommend you try this gastro pub,
"October 15, 2016","Great service, awesome drink variety, delicious food! Will definitely be going back",
"August 28, 2016",Just had the WORST steak ever! Service was just as bad.,
"July 7, 2016",...always  great friendly service...consistent food..awesome mixology drinks and beer /draft  choices......the background acoustic entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays are a nice  plus......the top level bar area is often utilized for events and private parties. ...√Ø  also  love a bar with history and uses that in it's name and theme etc.....the difference in the decor compared to the old  Lawrence of oregano is impressive! !.....a great place overall! !!,
"July 5, 2016","Actually, the food was quite good...was taken here for a retirement luncheon with some friends.",
"May 11, 2016",Really good service and the food was very good and affordable.,
"April 14, 2016","Thankyou for the evening of a well trained staff , great food, clean washrooms and INCREDIBLE flavorful locally brewed beer!  I will come here more often! Maybe a local lady will like to go out sometime?  just call me 902-488-8555",
"April 2, 2016","Great atmosphere, great people! Very nice, and good food too! A must when you are in halifax!",
"February 5, 2016",First time in and will certainly come back. food came fast and was of great quality. The drinks were exquisitely made and we were never left waiting. Thank you!,
"January 31, 2016","Took a group of 10. In the 2 hours we were there, we were served one drink each and no food. Staff just kept ignoring us. When we finally got our bills (that took 20 minutes once we requested them), as an ""apology"" the staff told us we should go somewhere else as they are simply too busy to serve us. They didn't have any issues with serving new people who were coming in at all. This was a group of 10 professionals who were out to enjoy a nice evening of some food and drinks.... I guess we didn't have enough pretty girls in their 20's at our tables as your staff had no problems tending to them.",
"December 5, 2015","Loved the food, the atmosphere and the music by local artist, Casey May.",
"October 6, 2015",Awesome food served with a winning attitude!!!!...I highly recommend that you drop what you're doing and go there now:-),
"August 23, 2015","Divine intervention has us find The Auction House.  And we couldn't be happier, an upscale atmotishere, high end food, exceptional, friendly, personal staff.  The Spur-of-the-moment Auctions added a fun element to the evening as well as supporting charitable causes.  Cannot stop raving about this Halifax hot spot!  Thanks for the great evening.   Ps.  If Matthew is your server you are in for a treat!!!","August 23, 2015"
"August 18, 2015","Was in Halifax recently for a friend's wedding & decided to grab brunch here a Saturday morning. There was only 1 other table in the restaurant, and service was extremely slow. Food was mediocre, and based on the service + food experience, we had food at much better restaurants in the area. Would really have to think hard about going back here for brunch.",
"August 17, 2015","The Auction House is an outstanding establishment. The food was absolutely delicious. The service was excellent. Music was great.  Nathan, the GM was friendly, personable and helped to make for us a fantastic evening. Highly recommend The Auction House for a guaranteed great night out! The Auction House is a cut above the rest.",
"August 17, 2015","Great service, awesome atmosphere-great fish and chips!",
"August 16, 2015","I had the mussels and beet salad and both were very good. Nice atmosphere, great service and great music. I would definitely go back!",
"August 8, 2015",We were in last night for a bachelorette party and the food and service was AMAZING! Mike our waiter was exceptional and went above and beyond! Would recommend to anyone!,
"June 1, 2015","Food:   My wife and I had lunch there and we each had a different dish.  Both were truly amazing. Stellar flavors and cooked perfectly.  They also keep a lot of great craft beers on tap.   Service:  Very friendly, funny, and helpful.  Also, really knowledgeable about local breweries.  Atmosphere: If you haven't been in the Auction House, I recommend you check it out.  The feel of it is laid-back, elegant & modern. Every time I'm in there, the music is perfect too. I often hear great tunes from the 90's.  This was truly and amazing dining experience and I obviously recommend it.",
"May 20, 2015","Such good food, delicious drinks & the nicest staff ever! (Especially the very helpful waiter with the bike and ponytail). One of our favourite spots in Halifax!",
"March 6, 2015","Good food, good beer, awesome place just downtown Halifax!",
"November 9, 2014",Excellent service and the food was amazing! I would come back again just to have more of the scrumptious seafood chowder!!,
"September 7, 2014","Sometimes you find a restaurant that is truly exceptional!! The food, service, atmosphere and management are unlike any I have experienced! Consistent and mouthwatering food! They host auctions daily that present you not only with entertainment, but they donate all money raised to that months spotlighted  local charity! I can not say enough about this restaurant!! Simply amazing!!!",
"March 23, 2014","Charming atmosphere, lots of natural light during the day. Had the Andouille burger for $5 during burger week...delicious! Friendly device to boot. Looks like it could be a fun, busy spot at night.",
"March 21, 2014",Had lunch for the first time here today. EXCELLENT service and equally excellent food! Will be back again soon to use my 20% off Brunch coupon!,
"February 22, 2014","This place is absolutely great, except the band. 2 scoops of raisins? This place deserves a good east coast band. Some kinda folk music, not cover bands playing rough versions of mid 90's pop hits. Other than that, love the place.",
"January 27, 2014","My Husband & I just stumbled upon this fabulous restaurant on Saturday night before we went to the hockey game. What a great spot!! The food was excellent, the atmosphere was upscale pub & the service was very friendly. Plus the food was priced reasonably. This will be our new ""go to""  restaurant.",
