January 3,"Food is very expensive. Went for brunch. The least expensive bacon and egg dish is $8.50. If the food was outstanding, or organic perhaps, but it was not. Also the music was so loud, pounding in my ears as if we were at a dance bar late at night instead of at noon. Ridiculous. Would not go again.  There are so many other places in Halifax whose prices are reasonable and you can carry on a conversation and enjoy a relaxing meal.",
"October 1, 2017",I had lunch today with my daughter and a friend and his toddler son.  Our server was Rachael. She was very attentive to the needs of our table (a young child and myself with many anaphylactic allergies).  She took the time to checknover menu option to ensure the safest meal for me and also communicated with the chef as well.  Definitely will be back!,
"September 23, 2017","The food was delicious. The waitress was salty. Celebrating my engagement with some friends and the waitress slides my tip back to me. I tell her to keep the change and she flips on her rude attitude she was holding off on until tip time to tell me to keep it. Thanks for embarrassing me in front of my friends and spoiling my night. Kudos to the chef, the veggie burger was incredible, but the waitress could use some training.",
"November 19, 2017",I ordered a sangaria and after few sips I noticed a bug in it.. looked like a cinch worm and the girl I was with had a dirty glass that her water came in.. still had to pay for my drink in the end ...the food was good service was ok...,
"November 25, 2017","I’ve always been told by friends , next time in Halifax to try My fathers moustache. So this time I did. One of the best meals I’ve had in a long time, reasonably price, great atmosphere and great service. Definitely gonna try again and suggest this one to everyone.",
"October 1, 2017","Had the pub club,, always a sure fire hit...my good friend had an alergy to shell fish; our waitress Rachael was very accommodating and patient...took the time to confer with the kitchen and had a great meal....way to go!! will be back",
January 4,Best wings I’ve ever had and best bbq sauce to go with them. Ribs and nachos are also amazing. Literally have never had a disappointing meal here.,
February 18,"First time here and really enjoyed it! Good was great, our waitress was awesome and they even had live music while we ate! Great atmosphere for a date night � we will definitely be back!",
"July 23, 2017","So me and the little one (4 years old) popped in for a quick bite and a drink waiting for the Pride Parade to kick off yesterday and I have to say everything was awesome. Our waitress was very friendly and engaged well with my daughter (still didn't get a word out of her though, so shy with people!) and checked in on us regularly after we'd placed our order. I ordered the combo (chicken strips, mozza sticks, potato skins and bacon), which was delicious, and the little one had... a small order of blueberry pancakes. They must have been good too because she ate half of them (which is an achievement for her). The high point of the visit was definitely just before we left though, the little one decided she needed to use the little girl's room, so I sent her on in and told her to just give me a shout when she was done. She was in there a while, but then I heard the hand drier going and she came back out with a female member of staff who had helped her wash her hands and dry them off. I was over the moon she got some help in there, above and beyond the call of duty right there, super impressed! I've always liked this place, but I have to say I like it even more now! Prices are very reasonable for a downtown eatery / drinkery too!",
"November 26, 2017",Had family here from New Brunswick so went to out to have good food and listen to great music at Your Fathers Moustache. Joe Murphy just happens to be a cousin always great to listen to the band,
January 19,"The server was much better than the last time we were there. Very good service.  Still pretty pricy, even for a wing night....",
January 27,"Amazing! Friendly and knowledgeable staff, awesome music, a good crowd of people, and delicious food.",
"November 1, 2017",Awesome service and great draft/food! Thanks to the ladies for helping us have such great time!,
"July 29, 2017",Waitresses are busy talking in the corner had to go get our own drinks and bartender who was involved in waitress conversation made us feel like we were an inconvenience. Sorry wish it had 0 stars should be an option. Especially when you see complaining it is a slow Saturday because of the tall ships,
March 6 at 11:34am,Pub Club is the best sandwich ever! I don't go to Halifax without getting one!,
"June 11, 2017","Waited about 75-85 minutes for food (chicken burgers, all quick and easy aside from one order of mussels). It was busy - but nothing out of control (most people were just getting nachos and drinks). When our food arrived, it was cold and my buddy had a few mussels that had opened up but completely raw, and cold. They comp'ed his bill (kind of have to at that point) which was good, but there's a clear problem in the kitchen. Pub food is meant to be efficient, quick, and easy. ...Draft beer was great, but the specialty coffees didn't have any garnish or whipped cream (they looked super unappetizing and weren't well received). Our server was nice and understanding, but from someone who works and has worked in the industry for 7+years it was clear that she knew things weren't going well and didn't want to talk to us about it. TIP: just telling your table ""just so you guys know, there's a long wait for food right now"" goes a REALLY long way. Don't leave your tables in the dark, and talk to them like people and not like customers. Last time I will be eating here unfortunately until they make some changes.",
"June 3, 2017","Nice patio and friendly service, however we were told it may be up to 30 minutes for food which was long but okay considering they were busy. We ordered and decided to go with a Chicken Pub Club  sandwich w/fries and a Salad (shouldn't take too long). Considering it was only a sandwich and Salad, 30 minutes is pushing it, but after around 1 hour we had still not received our food. Finally after around 60 minutes our mediocre sandwich and salad arrived. The only problem was that there was no chicken in my sandwich. Feel bad for the servers cause clearly the kitchen can't get it together. Won't be back unless it's for a beer, at lest they were cold.",
"June 16, 2017","Went there last night for wing night but we decided to order meals. It was around 5 oclock, our order was taken right away! We got our food super quick I even said to our waitress that was like less then 15 minutes for a customized Buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and a Pub Club customized wih fries. And wings to go! Was awesome service, drinks were served instantly, waitress was super friendly! Great experience! The stache is my fave downtown :)",
February 11,Great service great food and drink and the band was great took look forward to going back real soon!,
March 14 at 12:48am,Went with a group of 10. Service was extremely great (Jenna). Food was very good - said 9 out of 10 if us. Look feel (environment) was unique and cool. Really glad I went..great experience!,
"June 23, 2017",We had a 40  min wait for 10 wings and a fish taco on wing night . I don't mind waiting for my food  if I am out for the night having fun .but when you wait 40 min for your food it should be hot when you get it  not cold !!!. Ours was cold.,
"September 13, 2017",Very good chowder! Calamari was mediocre but had nice dips. Buddy had a Burger which he liked very much. Patio was good fun and our waitress was cute and very helpful & friendly.,
"August 11, 2017","I enjoyed my time here very much, the atmosphere has a certain level of classiness to it, the food is very good, the hospitality is great and our server in particular was very sweet, made us feel comfortable and was just a sweet heart.",
January 16,"Great supper, The food was delicious! Highly recommend this restaurant.",
"July 15, 2017","We got their around 3:00 and we able to sit on the patio...it was a beautiful day and our lunch was pretty good ...we had salads, potato skins, chicken wings and chicken Alfredo...everything was delicious ...we will  come back again very soon...we just love sitting on the patio in the summer...:)",

I gu5its a hot and miss place. Before I ate there Saturday I would of recommend it.  I'm not so sure about that now.",
"June 15, 2017",$16 for 10 anorexic chicken wings that looked like they could of came off a humming bird. Extremely disappointing.  For the price there should be some actual meat on them not just deep fried breading.,

"May 19, 2017","Reasonable atmosphere, average service. Nice deck on a sunny warm day.",
"July 2, 2017","Went for a Sunday brunch today and left after one hour and 20 minutes with no sign of our eggs benny. The server had no tableside manner, never cleaned off our table until we had been sitting there for 25 minutes, we waited 30 minutes for our drinks and she never returned to ask if we wanted another and then gave me attitude when I asked for the drinks bill as we had waited more than enough time. Will never return there food and will never recommend it to anyone either!",
"April 22, 2017","Always a very accommodating place the food we had yesterday was the best and the friendly server is so pretty and helpful it makes the Friday happy hour smooth, thanks Stella �",
"April 16, 2017",I had eaten here before for supper and loved the menu. We arrived at 12:45 and sat ourselves. A server never came to our table until 15-20 minutes after we sat down. Understandable if the place was full but it was at 1/3 capacity. 4 waitresses were chatting at the cash the whole time. The food was good and the waitress was very friendly. I was also disappointed at the brunch menu being in effect until 3pm as it was very limiting.,
"April 10, 2017",Scrambled eggs were very dry.  Did not get eaten. Egg breakfast sandwich - bread tasted sour.   Friendly service but not fast.   Usually is much better.,
"April 9, 2017","Excellent food, the band that played was awesome and the service was very fast! I will be back",

"March 22, 2017",My son and 2 grandson's are visiting from Port Alberni and we had lunch here yesterday. Steve (my son) and I both had the Cheese and Bacon Burger. We are both in agreement. It was without a doubt the best burger either of us have ever had.I understand that the beef is freshly ground on site and it really comes through in the flavour.The mixture of cheeses on the burger was amazing and we were still talking about the burger later that afternoon.I should point out that Steve is an executive chef in Port Alberni. The service was beyond excellent - unfortunately I have forgotten his name but he is a real asset to YFM. Thanks for an awesome lunch.,
"March 21, 2017",Had a rib steak with my kids 2 and 4 years old and we got food poisoning called them didn't even get a call back....,

"February 19, 2017","We didn't realize when we went there was a live band there, it was soooo loud we couldn't hear anyone at our table. It was an awesome band but was too loud.",
"February 18, 2017","So was in Halifax today and though I would treat myself to a nice eggs Benedict. Back when I lived in the city always was at the moustache every weekend for brunch (eggs Benedict). Place itself now looks great wish I could say the same for the eggs...  1 - eggsbenidect are poached NOT fried... If I wanted fried eggs on a English muffin I would have gone and got a egg McMuffin 2 - eggsbenidect are made with backbacon not ham.... Once again egg McMuffin would have been a better... fit 3 - hollandaise sauce... Not sure what that was but was not hollandaise... Have eaten canned hollandaise that tastes better... No wait I mean  actually had a taste... ( From feedback I got from waitress I'm apparently not the 1st to complain about the hollandaise) 4 - toast, first off not sure why anyone would include toast with benny figure english muffin would be enough... What about having more spread options than just strawberry and peanut butter Good things - overall other than plain sauce meal was palatable asked for runny eggs and the were (just fried not poached) side of sausage was tasty (qty reduced since last time I was in from 3 links to 2). Waitress was efficient and attentive and order was quick to table  Well to sum things up farwell old haunt as think today will have been my last visit to this establishment. I will try and block out today and just keep memories of the good times from the past and the good food from those times. ... Shame on you Shaun for cutting corners on food quality.",
"February 17, 2017",It's one of the amazing places that have chicken wings!!! 😍😍😍,
"January 31, 2017",loved it!!  We were looking for some good food in a place with good atmosphere ... Your Father's Moustache Pub had both and more.,
"January 27, 2017","Food is absolutely amazing, and the service is above what it has to be! The waiter was amazing and came by whenever we needed her. Definitely will come back to eat here again in the future!",

"January 20, 2017",Your Father's Moustache is quite simply the best chicken wing joint on this planet...,
"January 14, 2017","My husband and I had brunch there this morning for our anniversary, and it was one of the best meals we have had in a long time!  The staff was super friendly and the food was delicious!",
"January 6, 2017","Love visiting and catching up with Joe Murphy, who was my Jr high gym teacher before he became a big star :)  Food is great and atmosphere is chill.",
"January 1, 2017","Our fav Halifax breakfast. The place was packed today (New Years day) but they had a huge team of staff on. We waited a reasonable amount of time for our food, but the server apologized for the wait several times. Plenty of good coffee and the best blueberry pancakes around.",
"January 1, 2017",Really good food and drinks. Staff were polite and helpful. It was a quite night and I am very glad my boyfriend and I went there. I recommend going and I will be returning again.,

Everywhere i go i get 2 piece fish and chips...the fish were small.. i would normally eat 1 and take the other home i ate both i think it was cooked well little to no seasoning tho. For what it cost 15 something before tax which is alot for a 2pc it was more like a 1pc. Other than portion size the service was ok but if I went back i wouldnt get the fish. Sorry,

"September 26, 2016","The moustache was always one of my fav spots to go when I went to Dalhousie University about 8 years ago. I came back to it just this Saturday to reminisce and take my BF there to show him why I loved it. My love for this place is now tainted:( No longer serving deep fried pepperoni nor MooseLight (my staples! Lol) I was disappointed. Then came the waitress...she was snotty and acted like she could care less. (She had dark hair, red lips and hoop earrings. Calling her out yes.) Never saw her for the rest of our service, had someone else deliver our food and didn't check in. Just act like you care, maybe you'd get a better tip next time. Not the happy space I remember:(",
"September 21, 2016",Great place. Lobster Roll was fantastic and service was amazing. Beer wasn't bad either.,
"September 20, 2016",I had quite a delicious feast here this evening. The service was great (thanks again Lindsey!) and the atmosphere was very lively and relaxing all at once. I highly recommend this pub.,

So we left, I have never been talked to like this in an establishment before, we went to another restrauant and was welcomed and they gave us a plate for our son, we stayed a long time and spent lots, your loss I guess. I will make sure I spread the word.",
"July 31, 2016",good eats and friendly staff. Service was fast and lots of seating.,
"July 29, 2016",Great food & service !! Highly recommanded,
"July 27, 2016","I ordered the Chicken and Mushroom Penne Pasta to go. I got back to my hotel room and opened the package. The outside of the take out box looked dirty, and one of the napkins had a red pepper mashed into it.  The actual food was boring, way too oily and the bacon tasted like it was freezer burnt.  I am disappointed and sad as this place was recommended to me by some friends who really enjoy it    :(",
"July 25, 2016",I like the service. And the food is wonderful. Ordered a lot of food from this place. And was worth every penny.,
"June 25, 2016","Classic Pub fare, food was good, check out the men's room.",
"June 23, 2016","One of my favourite eateries in Halifax with a great atmosphere at any time of the day. The food is reasonably priced, plentiful and extremely good. Servers have always been upbeat, friendly and efficient.  As an aside, Ladies, ask for a glimpse of the guys washrooms- it'll make you smile. I'll say no more",
"June 2, 2016","Des ribs au top, un service de qualité ,un roof top ! Bref une excellente soirée .",

"March 21, 2016",Excellent food and service! Poutine reccomended highly :),
"March 8, 2016","I came in tonight hoping to get the half off pasta as I have many times in the past. I double checked the website to make sure this was still a deal on Tuesday nights. I saw the Tuesday picture was pasta, so this made me believe the special was still going. When I came in I was surprised to learn this was not the case. I felt disappointed and very mislead by the website.",
"February 15, 2016",Had a great brunch here on Valentine's Day. The server was great at her job. This place came highly recommended and I would definitely return.,
"January 8, 2016",Awesome place!! I've only been there once but I really enjoyed my food and experience! ❤,
"January 1, 2016",I was there tonight for New Years Eve and everything was great. The waitress was very friendly,
"August 26, 2015","Was one of the best places I've ever ate, I recommend the gormet Mac and cheese! The server was also beyond polite and on top of it all!",
"July 6, 2015","I usually enjoy going to this restaurant, I have been to it many times, but last night was one of worst experience I ever had and for that I suggest to fix up your services and train your managers to be more respectful to an unhappy customer. Sunday at 10pm there were barely any customers at the restaurant and we waited about 15 minutes until I finally waived at a waiter to come to our table and I immediately asked for the manager, she then came to us and we explained to her ...how no one decided to come to our table while a couple of the waiters passed right by us and did nothing, yet again there were 3 waiters standing right infront of us laughing and having conversation and the manager had the nerve to say ""all the waiters were busy"" yet again she says "" your waiter is here now if you would like to order if not you can leave."" How is that for fixing a situation and that is the manager that did that. Bravo you guys just lost a very loyal customer due to untrained unprofessional so called manager.",
"June 18, 2015",Cold beer! Great Service! Rooftop patio!!! What more does anyone need?,
"May 5, 2015",Recieved the worst service here. My waitress forgot to give me all of my change back when I payed for my meal and then argued with me and accused me of lying when I told her. She refused to let me talk to the mananger and was completely unprofessional. Will not be eating here again.,
"April 28, 2015",After leaving another restaurant due to bad/no service was happy to see the overwhelming service and pleasantries at this restaurant. Well done,
"April 10, 2015","Best chowder EVER - Thanks Johnny for the hospitality, will be back in a few weeks. Cheers!",
"December 26, 2014","I love the food, and it's always great service! :)",
"December 5, 2014",Awesome brunch..:),
"August 14, 2014","Great food, terrible service. I'm writing this at minute 22 in my wait for my bill. 5 tables seated after me have come and gone. The other waiting staff is doing great, seems our is the exception.",
"July 30, 2014","I normally have a pretty good experience when dining at the Mustache so I was very surprised and disappointed by the experience I had last night. Last night I and my girlfriends went to The Mustache for drinks and dinner. We love the patio. I have never in my life been so disappointed with the food and the service. It was absolutely appalling. I’m not one to complain in person or even on social media, life is too short to sweat the small stuff but I am so upset and bothered b...y the experience I had last night  I thought I would take to social media. Upon arrival we ordered our food. I had a calamari appetizer.  The server asked me how I would like the sauce, tossed or on the side, leaving out that there would be a charge for those sauces. That’s fine but tells me you are charging me for something. We waited quite some time for our food, and when they finally brought it up they brought up my two girlfriends first and then almost ten minutes later, myself and my other girlfriends foods. My calamari was cold and rubbery. It was so awful I just stopped eating it. Did my server ask me why I had half my meal on my plate no? My girlfriend’s meals were also luke warm. To add insult to injury they charged my roommate for a refill. Did they inform her of this charge? NO. For an 18.99 cold plate of calamari I was less than impressed and left feeling taken advantage of. Later that evening myself and three other girlfriends became ill with a stomach flu. This could be due to a completely different issue but it seemed fishy as we had all ate in the same place. As I said I’m not one to complain but I left very upset.  I will never eat at this establishment ever again.",
"July 18, 2014","I absolutely love the Stache!! Great service & the food is always tasty! If you're lucky enough to have Brownie as your server, be prepared to tip! He's so awesome!! :)",
"July 4, 2014",Most of the time when I come here its amazing.. This time is the worst ever though.. definitely do NOT recommend their clams... they were soggy and gross... and VERY expensive for the amount and the quality.. very disappointed..... what happened?!You used to be sooooo good!,
"March 28, 2014","Fast, friendly & delicious!",
