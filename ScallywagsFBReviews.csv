January 4,"Christina is the best.. amazing cut every time. But don't make her too busy, I need to get my regular cut!",
"September 8, 2017","Highly recommend this place, I've had my hair cut by almost all of the staff and they are all very talented and a good bunch of ppl , Thanks scallywags",
February 20,Plan ahead and book your next haircut at this fine establishment. I've been to Christina a couple of times and she does a great job.,

March 17 at 12:53pm,Best barbershop in the city. Brad is the man. Highly recommended.,
January 24,Great atmosphere knowledgeable barbers you won’t be disappointed going here,
"March 31, 2015","Not usually the kind of guy to come and rate service but I just had to today, one of the best barbershop experiences I have had while in Halifax, if anyone who has not heard of these two fine gentlemen you are defiantly missing out, let's break it down -booking: easily obtained from the bio to the ""resurva"" application, quick and easy to navigate  -area: fantastic location in a residential part of the North end of Halifax with abundant parking on the back streets without payi...ng silly tolls -atmosphere: great hands on attitude from these two great guys, all the work was done by themselves showing their true passion for their vision, beautiful reclaimed wood for their worktop, great music and the conversation was perfect -barbers: I find that finding a barber is one of the harder things you can do in life and once you find one that fits your laughing, these guys come off warm and inviting (and no I'm. It trying to pick you up for a date) and they offer top caliber haircuts and actually pull them off with high precision, I asked for a razor fade to a 1 (high and tight with a straight razor) which I find to be one of the most difficult cuts to pull off, ended up being one of my favourite cuts I have had in a while. In summary, I'm glad to see that Halifax is broadening its outreach to the art of proper barbershops (the way that they are suppose to be) and now with scallywags opening in the north end its another option for people who take pride in buying local and looking great!  Keep up the good work guys glad to be able to make it in on day one!",
"October 27, 2015","Brad and Dylan are some of the best in the business. From my first cut, I've always been happy with the results. Both guys are also personable, which makes the experience far more enjoyable - no need for awkward small talk. Booking an appointment is about as easy as it gets, check out their website and you'll know what I mean. Cheers fellas!",
