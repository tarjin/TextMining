"November 11, 2017","Went to the restaurant to celebrate a friends bday. Had a glass of wine and when it came the glass was filthy and asked for a new glass. Server was long to bring a new glass back. Had to ask twice for a glass of water. Ordered a dessert and never got it. The women's bathroom is in need of some repairs. Gouges and holes in the walls, chipped paint. Frames of the mirrors made of MDF and all water damaged and peeling. Management really should pay attention to those little things as they do leave an sour impression. Service was very slow. Friend and guests seemed to enjoy their food but I won't be going back. Also, reservations were made to have a longer table with a water view and they assured we would have it then we got there and it was given to another group. Too bad because I enjoyed my experience last summer there.",
January 20,"Have never been here before so thought we would try it through the ""Dine Around' experience. i figured they must  have put on some favorites.  I started with the calamari-way too salty and heavily battered, could hardly taste the calamari.  My friend had seafood chowder was good.  I had steak sandwich med well came well done and VERy fatty Other was butter chicken which was also good. Mine was so bad I won't be back but my friend says he will so.....",
"October 12, 2017","We come to this spot quite often. I wish I remembered our servers name to give her the props she deserves. Dark hair and glasses. My husband and the two kids love the view from the patio. Love how we are remembered. Drinks and all. We will be back. And as a fellow server , our server was one of the best I've had. So thank you.",
"August 22, 2017","Anytime I travel I try to find a place that makes you feel welcome like home. I stopped at several places along the harbor front and Gahan's was the best. Very friendly and out going staff. Food is fantastic and reasonably priced. They have their own beer selection and they also have a decent selection of other beers. I was there several days back in July 12 - 15. Can't say enough about the staff Taylor, Matt, Nicole, Maddie, John, Brent, Joel, Taylor and Kyleigh. Sorry if I forgot anyone or got spelling wrong on any names. I will definitely stop back my next time in Halifax.",
March 5 at 4:16pm,Overall both the food and the service  were good  we had one small issue with an overcooked steak but that happens I will definitely return.,
"August 23, 2017","This is one of my favorite places to go, but on Tuesday evening the service was ridiculously slow. We waited a long time for our orders and for dessert. It was my mother's birthday and her first experience here and it wasn't a great one. I would usually give this place a 5 because it is usually amazing. But maybe it was just a bad nigt",
"August 22, 2017","The food was mostly good, the broccoli salad didn't taste good but other then that the food was good. Ate outside & one of the pigeons got startled when runners ran pass & flew up in the air & pooped, it landed on my daughter-in-law visiting from Alberta, she was not too happy! But those things happen when you choice to enjoy the outdoors! We would go back again.",
"July 31, 2017","Wait was a little long, but we were there during the Tall Ships Festival, so we expected it to be. Notification by text that your table was ready and they would hold it for 10 minutes, worked perfectly. Staff were all very friendly and willing to accommodate. Food was very good. Brown bag fish and chips was excellent. The fish looked like it was a little over done, but it was NOT. It was fresh and light. I had one of their in-house ales with mine ( Beach Chair Lager) and it was a very nice beer. My friend had the Sir John A Honey Wheat Ale. It was a nice, light, refreshing beer, as well. The atmosphere was friendly and inviting and we wouldn't hesitate to eat and drink here during another visit to the Halifax Harbour Waterfront.",
"November 19, 2017",Great atmosphere and good food. Very conscious of food allergies � and the best patio in Halifax! Always enjoy going here.,
"July 30, 2017","We had to wait an exceptionally long time, even though they were not crazy busy. To be fair, the hostess did warn us about an hour wait for food. We ordered fish and chips and when it came, an hour later, the fries were delicious but the fish was very burnt and yet somehow soggy like it had been sitting for awhile. Gross. If we went back, we would not be ordering the fish and chips.",
"June 27, 2017","I was visiting Halifax during a road trip and was walking the harbourfront with my dog assuming I wouldn't be able to sit down for a drink since I had her with me. The waitress welcomed me to tie her to the rail beside my table and I was able to sit down on the patio for some great sangria and awesome fish cakes. They even brought out a big bowl and a pitcher of water for my dog without me asking. Loved the service and the food, and was very happy I was able to find a dog-friendly place to sit and enjoy the habourfront over a drink. Very satisfied �",
"August 27, 2017","My wife and I visit Halifax annually and this is definitely one of our favourite patio stops. Being a lover of Red beers , I very much enjoy The Gahan House Island Red! The service has always been very good , no sooner do I finish a beer and a server is there checking to see if I want another  The food is also very good !  Especially the seafood chowder!!  Soooooo good!!!  Great location for both views of the harbour and to people watch!  Always look forward to our visits here and highly recommend!",
"July 13, 2017","We dropped in for lunch on a Wednesday.  There were tables inside but we wanted an outside table and were given a 15 minute wait time.  However by the time we bought a drink from the bar our table was ready.  We were served quickly and chose the hamburgers which were bought out pretty quickly.  Food was tasty and chips nice and crunchy.  The view was lovely.  Our waitress looked a bit fed up but she was very professional.  I think weekends would be manic but we certainly enjoyed our experience, and had a leisurely second beer without any pressure to vacate our table",
"June 30, 2017","The service was very poor. My daughters drink had no ice cubes. Did not get utensils until the waitress dropped my steak knife and when she brought back a new steak knife she just placed the forks on the table and never gave them out. The kids hamburger was just that a bun with a burger. No lettuce, tomato, mustard, relish. My steak bun was hard and the broccoli salad was very bland, not much dressing. Spoke with a co- worker who was there with 4 other guys from work and he said the same thing, he will never go back.",
"October 8, 2017","Went there two times last week with my aunt and both times we had a great experience. Great selection of draft beers, I particularly enjoyed the blueberry pale ale. Mention spéciale à Erin pour son excellent service et son accueil, merci!",
"September 16, 2017","Dropped in for a cold beer while wandering about the harbour front. Service was slow - they didn't seem to be overly interested if you weren't eating there as well.  Can't comment on food quality. Found better places for a cold beer, with better service and atmosphere.",
"August 3, 2017",Long wait for inside table but seated right away outside.  Local beer and scallops were tasty.   Enjoyed our cheeseburgers.  It was cool and fog filling in - nice touch was offering blankets for warmth.   We would definitely go back if in Halifax again.,
"July 24, 2017","first time visiting halifax this weekend. beautiful waterfront, waoooooo is all i can say. nice to sit at ghan house to enjoy food on saturday and enjoy the view. I had the tacos with tofu and it was really nice. everyone said to try seafood in nova scotia but as vegetarian i can enjoy the fries only. fries are tasty here. my friends eat fish so they order brown bag fish and said it was fresh and tasty.",
"September 2, 2017","Had lunch outside, a little breezy but enough sunshine to make it pleasant.  Food was very good and served hot!  Really enjoyed the Sir John A wheat ale!  Excellent service too!",
"July 22, 2017","Disappointed, have been here before but this evening had friends from Oz with us. Ordered 2 burger meals and 2 tacos meals. Both burgers were overcooked (black). Took 10 mins to replace and then my Wife's burger tasted like a pot of salt had been poured over it, Pat's wasn't quite as bad. They did knock off a meal and drink from the bill but won't be going back in a hurry.",
"November 5, 2017",Amazing spot !!! Food was delicious ! Server was awesome !! And if course the beer !!!!! Definatly be back soon !,
"September 22, 2017","Love the place. Food was, excellent. Staff were friendly and helpful. Enjoy my first meal of my holiday in Halifax.",
"August 17, 2017",We had to wait around 45 min to get our food which was not very good. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,
"August 26, 2017",We didn't get any cutlery except a large spoon....I ordered a chicken dish. Our waitress looked bored and never asked us if we wanted dessert coffee etc.,
"September 21, 2017","Fantastic spot! Great beer , delicious food and fantastic staff! A must try for sure !!",
"September 1, 2017","We love going to the Gahan House. The atmosphere is nice , and the food was really good! The service was great too!",
"July 4, 2017","What a great place to go! Fresh delicious oysters, great staff and food. Lots of people so it might be slow to wait but it's so worth it!",
"October 14, 2017","Fantastic fish � tacos �, and lobster roll. Great service and great atmosphere.",
"July 18, 2017","I have gone twice and both times the service was poor, food was bland and if you can't make a proper Tom Collins you shouldn't be behind a bar.",
"June 25, 2017","Very long wait, ignored by waitresses for over 20 mins when we first sat down. Food (chips from a bag) took an hour to get even though we were told there would be no wait. All the food was cold and not very flavourful.",
"October 14, 2017",The raw muscles were delicious!!! The service was great and good atmosphere.,
"June 14, 2017","The ambience, service and food has always and remains superb. However, never having ordered coffee here before; being charged for a refill was a definite tip reducer. Certainly not the fault of the server but something the management should maybe take note of.",
"August 16, 2017","Great location , food was good, service on the slow side but staff was pleasant. Would return again. The buffalo cauliflower was fantastic! A must try",
"June 8, 2017",Went for lunch today. Kitchen was very slow. Took over 45 min to get our food. Our server was nice and the food was good. But I don't like to scarf down my lunch in 10 minutes I had left for lunch.,
"September 5, 2017","The food, location, and beer was fantastic.....the server was ...mah. would definitely go back though",

"July 25, 2017","Went with a group of friends , service was poor. Ordered nachos, very disappointed. There was nothing on the them , paid a lot of money for plain chips.",
"August 8, 2017",Best restaurant I have gone to in a long time .. Food was fanatic and so was our server Joel !,
"September 17, 2017","Food was great. Atmosphere was equal to their location, casual and beautiful. On the waterfront!!",

"July 19, 2017","Great view, fast service and awesome mussels in coconut curry sauce. Sangria was pretty tasty too.",
"August 1, 2017",Was disappointed that they ran out of fish cakes.  But still a great place. Bacon wrapped scallops were wonderful.,

"September 18, 2017","The food was great, as well as the servers. Loved watching the harbour traffic.",

"July 13, 2017","Страхотна бира,вкусни ястия и прекрасен поглед към залива!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
"May 8, 2017",The food was EXCELLENT and our server was absolutely amazing- I wish I could remember her name as she deserves to be recognized! Will definitely be back :-),
"May 7, 2017","loved it ..great food and the service was def.,5 stars!",
"April 30, 2017","A cerveja é sensacional, mas a comida é aquilo que se espera de um Pub: gordurosa e calórica! Só dá para comer até os 25 anos e olhe lá! Depois disto só acompanhada de AAS!",
"April 28, 2017",Fairly disappointed we had a couple of apps each the pretzel was okay but fairly difficult to pull apart the cheese sauce was cream cheese and the Asian sticky ribs was very fatty with no stickiness at all not cooked enough and tasteless,
"April 24, 2017",Awesome food also was really impressed with so much veggie options,
"April 9, 2017",Wonderful time...look forward to a return visit (all the way from New Brunswick),
"March 29, 2017",Absolutely amazing food. The staff was super friendly and quick!,
"March 25, 2017",Service was excellent!  Food and beer delicious!  Love the decor and atmosphere too. 😀,
"March 24, 2017","We came here for Burger Week and thought it was going to be a delicious burger, unfortunately it was not. For burger week this should not have been offered especially for the price of it.",
"March 18, 2017",Love It  Food Was Awesome  Beer Was Awesome  Great Service And Everything!!!!!!,
"March 5, 2017","Good food, awesome drinks and service. Joel was a great host. Awesome place to lay back and enjoy a nice evening with friends.",
"March 3, 2017",Exceptional in every way. From the house brewed beer to fantastic food to the service. I highly recommend the bacon wrapped halibut. Ron Swanson would be proud.,
"February 18, 2017","Amazing food, beer and atmosphere. Service was wonderful!",
"February 13, 2017",Awesome food with a super fun atmosphere. Great staff as well!,
"February 12, 2017","Loved it, will definitely go back. Service was excellent and very nice atmosphere. I had fish & chips and it was the best fish & chips I've had since moving here.",
"February 11, 2017",Love their fish and chips....excellent service..:),
"February 5, 2017","Food was average, servers need a bit more training to be able to give a better description of the beers brewed in house.",
"February 1, 2017",By OK I mean the food I ordered. The service was great and waitress was awesome...very patient and gave great detail about their menu.,
"January 26, 2017",Great service and ambiance. Good food & brews.,
"January 21, 2017",Adam Baldwin was playing the piano while we were there. What a great bonus to a fantastic meal.,
"January 15, 2017","Went for cocktails and apps. Food was decent, but unfortunately I attempted to order 3 of their different signature cocktails and was told they didn't have all the ingredients for them, the waitress did suggest good alternatives, but this is unacceptable for a Friday night.  Would definitely go again, but would be tentative, and if this were to happen again I wouldn't be able to recommend this as a good cocktail bar.",
"December 21, 2016","The first time I went to Gahan House this past July and the service was exceptional! Servers were pleasant and joyful. In the fall I had purchased a growler and when I brought it home I realized it was cracked so the following day I brought it back and even though the bottle was empty, the bartender, Taylor refilled it for me free of charge. After that some people at the bar engaged me in conversation to which Taylor also contributed to. It was a great half hour full of laugh...s and kindness. That was two months ago. This past week I returned to Gahan house to pick up more growlers and have lunch with my boyfriend. Even after that time had passed- Taylor still remembered who I was. She asked about my move my new house and my job. She had remembered our entire conversation. It's not typical that those in the service industry remember things like that! So thank you- Taylor for being such a kind hearted person! Gahan house is definitely my favourite place to go on the water front!",
"December 14, 2016","Excellent spot. Beautiful location, great selection of local craft beers, very friendly staff!",
"November 27, 2016","Absolutely delicious, so good I went back the next day.",
"November 26, 2016","Unbelievable beer, unbelievable food and even better service, Hghly recommend it",
"November 18, 2016",Iron Bridge brown is the best beer I've ever had �,
"October 21, 2016","Quick service, friendly staff, food was amazing and prices were right on par",
"October 18, 2016",Loved my first experience here today! Great service and the food surpassed my expectations! Can't wait to go back :),
"October 18, 2016","Our second visit and both fun experiences.  Good draft, good food, and great servers!",
"October 7, 2016","Unfortunately worst experience ever,  was handled ever so poorly by management.",
"October 1, 2016","We went to Halifax on buisness and really had no idea where to go eat, so we just started walking and somehow made our way to the waterfront and into Gahan House, so glad we did!  Not only did we get the best tasting oysters I've EVER had, we also got THE best service.  If and when you go, sit at the bar and hopefully you get served by the best bartender, Matt, who is not only genuine and attentive, but who's enthusiasm and knowledge of Nova Scotia will make you fall in love with it even more...and if you're really lucky, maybe he'll give you a demo on why he competes at the Oyster Festival! Good Luck today, Matt! ;)",
"September 28, 2016","Always a good experience - good food, friendly and great atmosphere.",
"September 22, 2016","The food was really great! It was nice to have gluten-free options, as well as cider on tap. Though portions are very large. Get an appetizer if you're not that hungry. The patio had a great view. Looking forward to visiting this place again!",
"September 16, 2016","WE eat the fishsoup... IT was so good! If we come again, wenn will visit you again. Greetings from Germany",
"September 11, 2016","We had the best food, ale and service I have ever received in Halifax. Beautiful seafood and wonderful local brews.  All the staff were so attentive and pleasant.  We dined outside by the boardwalk and enjoyed the setting sun.  This is an absolute must try if you are in town!",
"September 10, 2016","Amazing food, great prices and great staff. Looking forward to going back.",
"September 7, 2016",I have been to Gahan House twice in Halifax and both times were not the best. The first time was busy so I could understand if the appetizer was forgotten which was no big deal the waitress was wonderful. However returning a second time and ordering the Halibut tacos...The Tacos were amazing but my roasted veggies for the side weren't cooked and we're hard. after way in almost 45 mins for the meal this was dissapointing. I recently was at the Gahan house in Charlettetown Pei and had a Great Expirence Could be a hit Miss depending on the day.,
"August 15, 2016","While I would not say this was the worst meal I have ever had ... it was pretty close. I have just come home from dining with my daughter, wife and a few friends (a table of 7) at your Halifax location. The service was poor and almost non-existent, there was a 1 hour wait between appetizers and entree, when our entrees arrived ... our order was incorrect and some dishes had to be replaced. My wife and I had the fish and chips, which was over cooked and not fresh. Our mussels, while tasty, were almost cold. I am not sure if I would ever return here, nor would I recommend it.",
"August 13, 2016",This was our favourite restaurant in Halifax...absolutely loved everything we ordered!,
"August 11, 2016",My son favorite restaurant in Halifax!,
"August 10, 2016","Visited Halifax for the first time.  Wanted to try the Gahan. Showed up last night at 8:15 and was told they couldn't serve us as the kids couldn't be in the restaurant after 9:00pm. Went back tonight at 7:15 and again, once they saw the kids they told us they didn't have any tables available and that after waiting they wouldn't be able to get us out by 9:00pm. We left and walked around and could see several empty tables both inside and outside.",
"August 4, 2016","Great service (thanks, Maddy!) Tried Fish tacos...yum! Patio is perfect place to enjoy a summer evening with good friends.",
"July 10, 2016","We stopped in for a snack and three of us shared the nachos. Our food was delicious, especially the salsa. The server and hostess were friendly and pleasant. The atmosphere was wonderful, warm and inviting. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu",
"July 9, 2016","We have had great service every time and good food every time! Last night we were out to celebrate our wedding anniversary with some drinks and a number of apps and they were all amazing!  (The oysters were my fav and the calamari was my husbands).  Server was great.  Usually we like to go a bit later so we stay for the piano bar, but it wasn't on last night :(  A great place none the less!",
"June 8, 2016",Food and service both sucked and i seen the cooks smoking weed in the parking lot,
"June 2, 2016","Gahan house was unreal. The atmosphere was fun, vibrant, and real. The in house brewed beers were great. I would recommend the Blueberry Ale paired with the pulled pork sandwich. Had a great time the other night with my girlfriend there. 10/10 would recommend.",
"May 25, 2016","Awesome service. Great friendly staff from all over Canada! It was the first night the patio opened and they handled it so frigging well! And offers blankets when it gets chilly on that water front haha .. Such a good time :) I'll be back!!! Beer Cocktails, Sir John A and Beach Chair brews to be had!!",
"May 14, 2016","Staff was great. But the service was terrible and slow... My appetizer showed up in time for dessert.. beer was warm.. definitely won't ever go again, or recommend..",
"May 13, 2016",Very poor customer service. Will not be returning. Halifax we can do better.,
"April 21, 2016","Staff is great.  Food is small portions.  Clubhouse had 3 small pieces of chicken, maybe 1 small tomato slice and 1/2 slice of bacon.  Fries were cold.",
"March 30, 2016","Service and staff are very friendly and atmosphere is great. However, I got food poisoning from the chicken club last night. No one I was with was impressed by the food. Very mediocre food for the price you pay.",
"February 11, 2016",The menu was great. Food & service were excellent. Can't wait to come back! Just as warm & welcoming as the Charlottetown location!,
"February 7, 2016",Great spot right on the boardwalk. Good craft beers and my food was delicious.,
"December 21, 2015","Great service, great food, and great atmosphere!",
"December 8, 2015",Good beer but the lobster pizza was very poor.  Sat at the bar and could not believe how long it took bartender to offer a second beer.  I had to stop eating was so dry.  Usually bartenders don't make you beg for a second glass. Very unfriendly and not willing to converse.  Would go back for a beer but eat somewhere else.,
"December 5, 2015","Having nachos and beer and the service and beer are good, however the nacho portion is pretty poor for $15.99. I would have expected the dish to be much fuller. In,addition, we were a little shocked that the ink from the lining paper under the nachos transfers onto the cheese when you pull it off to eat it, which is quite off putting.",
"November 9, 2015","Great service, great food, great beer, unbeatable location, is there much more to ask?",
"September 28, 2015",I Love it!! Just as nice as the original in P.E.I!!,
"July 30, 2015","20 minute wait to sit... Hour wait for food... Waitress didn't ask how our food was at all... Likely because my fish and chips were completely soggy and barely hot when they came out and she didn't want me to tell her. Wouldn't have mattered anyways, because I didn't have time to wait for new food to be cooked. Heard such great reviews about this place and I know it's the buskers but come on.  Staff was nonchalant and made no effort to make us feel warm and welcome and the only reason we knew the food was behind because another sever told another table. Poor service makes for a bad outing and I am thoroughly unimpressed with Gahan House.",
"July 24, 2015","Love this place, great patio.  EXCELLENT service !",
"May 21, 2015",Craft beer at its finest still my all time favourite craft brew. If you are a fan of craft and in PEI or Halifax this is a must to visit!!!,
"May 15, 2015",We have visited the Haliax location a few times and also the original one in Charlottetown. Great menu and food both locations. Will be back.,
"March 18, 2015",Food served on cracked wooden cutting boards is a bacteria nightmare! The place looks nice though and the live music was brilliant!,
"February 7, 2015","The food and drinks were great. The service was fast and friendly. Please give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",
"January 9, 2015",worst service I have ever experienced in my entire life.,
"January 4, 2015","Food was good but I have a hard time ignoring the mice running around the dining area. The infestation must be severe if they are running freely out in the open like that. We alerted the hostess who didn't seem concerned at all. The ""it's the waterfront"" line is not an excuse....",
"October 5, 2014","Food, atmosphere and entertainment were great! Great addition to the Halifax waterfront! Will definitely be back!",
"September 20, 2014",Tonight was our second night there and we were not disappointed!  The food and staff there are phenomenal.  We started with deep fried potato chips (made from real potatoes) they are a must try you won't be disappointed either!! :),
"September 14, 2014",I love Gahan House in both NS & PEI. Glad to see this place open.,
"September 7, 2014","Impressed. We've lived on PEI and were very excited about the opening of the Gahan House in Halifax! I'm impressed. Amazing to sit here looking at the ocean with yummy beer and friendly staff. It just opened and is running smoothly and beautifully. I'm looking forward to spending a drizzly wet dark afternoon here watching the sea. Had fries, and they were perfect. No weird seasonings, just well cooked. Beers were perfect. I may have picked one that isn't my style but that was my error. Great time. Will return!",
"September 7, 2014","Gahan House on the Halifax Waterfront is a 11 out of 10 for my first visit. The waitress took the time to explain all the beers they had with out going on and on about how great they were. The food(veggie sandwich with roasted veggies) was delicious and filling. Waitress came over a few time to see if I like it all and what I though of the beer samples, and the prices were good. Will surely be back.Would like to see more veggie options but other than that well worth a visit or two or three!",
"September 4, 2014",Always a big fan! Always a great beer with great food and service!,
