"I would have put zero stars if that was an option but it wasn’t. I went to the fickle frog last night Monday March 5th after seeing a movie down the street. We sat ourselves and when we ordered our drink from the server we got carded (normal) and when I gave my Quebec Medicare card I was denied service. As it’s a legal ID I find this ridiculous, but as a past bartender/manager/bouncer of 4 years I didn’t cause a scene but I was furious that because my ID “didn’t have an address” I wasn’t allowed to drink.",March 6 at 10:10am,https://www.facebook.com/Menotu33/posts/10156221232249521:0,March 6 at 10:10am
"After a long day of travelling, I finally made it to Halifax where I was going to meet up with a big group of friends. After sitting patiently, waiting for everyone to arrive, the service I was provided with was so laughably horrible, that I had to cancel on everyone. The ridiculously cold manner in which one particular server treated me was just enough to ruin my evening. I wouldn't go back if they paid me. For people who work in the service industry, in my experience, they could use a lot of help with learning how to serve people. Absolutely terrible.","December 28, 2017",https://www.facebook.com/alastair.j.morrison/posts/10156032270932375:0,"December 28, 2017"
"The best thing about the bar was that the food was given too us for free because it was terrible, the potato skins were burnt and given with gravely? A chicken salad  sandwich was sent back because it was wrong, we asked for no olives on the nachos, so when we received them, they were loaded with olives, when we told the waitress she's had mentioned that she had already sent him back due to the olives being on it.  And there was one waitress (our waitress) who was running around waiting on all the tables, and looked like she had no help which was unfortunate for her, but she was working very hard and non stop so she got a tip.  But over all it was not very good and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, bad experience","September 22, 2017",https://www.facebook.com/ryan.g.board/posts/10159445084390327:0,"September 22, 2017"
"Wicked place, I was home from Alberta and craving a decent garlic fingers.  I wasn’t disappointed one bit.  Best garlic fingers I’ve had in 4 years.  Keep up the good work!",March 6 at 7:36pm,https://www.facebook.com/chris.tell.77/posts/10215833049964533:0,March 6 at 7:36pm

Great spot. Fast and friendly. They were playing trivia for prizes. They were able to deal with an unexpected large crowd that I'd gone in with from the Atlantic Film Festival.,"September 21, 2017",https://www.facebook.com/Kimzie/posts/10159345618815223:0,"September 21, 2017"
"I wandered in after a long Sunday morning walk while visiting town. (I was kinda lost) this was a nice quiet place to have Lunch with so cool local people hanging out. The service was quick and friendly. I broke down and got the ""big beer"" which is from Ontario instead of a local as I would normally. But, come on, you always take the big one on sale. I recommend but it did have a very small menu. That might have been because it was a Sunday morning but they accommodated me and found some wings to serve. It sounds like the nights are much more lively that my early visit.","June 12, 2017",https://www.facebook.com/jeffrey.everets/posts/10158789536675317:0,"June 12, 2017"

"I am a regular here and I suggested my work friends all do a fantasy football draft at this bar. Never again!  The ""new"" server cut one of the 10 of us off after having 4 pints of beer over a span of 4 hours. He was not slurring, he was not drunk, he was a bit annoyed because he had tried to get that pint about 30 minute prior and the server said ""hold on, I'm busy."" For a bar that was essentially empty, you should probably take care of your customers buying beer and have better judgement on who you can and cannot serve. After we were finished our draft 8 out of 10 people went next door, to the competition, and were treated very well. Your loss.","August 30, 2016",https://www.facebook.com/justin.murphy.315428/posts/10100884549648159:0,"August 30, 2016"
Trouble with many of these reviews is that they are close to trolling. There is usually a reason that is more the customer's fault for a negative review. I don't go here all that often but when I have the service and food has ALWAYS been excellent. Yesterday (Sunday) when the power was off on the other side of Spring Garden we (much to the delight of our two companions who simply just love this place) ended up here and had a most delightful time. It was busy but we were still waited on quickly and our meals were great. Plus Fickle Frog is much more economical on the menu front than some certain other Spring Garden establishments.,"October 24, 2016",https://www.facebook.com/tedew/posts/10202230946171682:0,"October 24, 2016"
