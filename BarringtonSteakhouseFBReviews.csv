"May 28, 2016","The people, atmosphere and food are all 5 stars. And a great date place.",
January 30,"After hearing nothing but great reviews of this restaurant, we finally tried it out tonight for my birthday and it was everything I hoped it would be. The moment we arrived, the staff were friendly, professional, relaxed. We chose to sit upstairs in the dining room where the full dinner menu was available because I was in the mood for a decent steak. As the hostess led us to our table, I was impressed by the serious, luxurious decor of the room. A small, walk-in, seamless gla...ss-walled wine cooler greets you at the top of the staircase. Lacquered wood tables flanked by large, dark gray, velvet-wrapped wingbacks, drum pendants hang overhead along the front windows. The center tables; curved banquettes in navy mohair, brass accent lighting casting down a soft golden glow. Cozy, yet sensuous. Our server, Rob, arrives promptly, was personable and knowledgeable. After looking at the drink menu, I chose a Hell Bay dark cream ale, perfect for a blustery, cold, January evening. The wine list is extensive but not overwhelming. The beer selection is carefully edited, a balanced mix of craft and factory. Spirits run the gamut. We peruse the dinner menu and it wasn't hard to make up our minds. Alex goes with the prix fix three-course winter Dine Around menu of a salmon appetizer, beef cheek marbella main, and a whoppie pie for desert. Filling to the point some of it came home for lunch tomorrow, all pre-selected items were approved of. I went with the Gochjang mussels-frites, basically chili paste and coconut milk with fresh basil. Delicious!  For my main, a juicy, Pittsburgh rare 8oz tenderloin encrusted with Stilton blue cheese melted in my mouth. Roasted fingerlings, beets, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower followed suit. Since I do not like chocolate, the dessert menu had 2 items sans-cocoa. As full as I was, one item looked too tempting to pass up. I went with the Apple Mille-Feuille. Cinnamon puff pastry with cider poached apples, and vanilla cream custard. A sizable portion but incredibly light. A perfect ending to an exceptional meal. It's no secret that Halifax has a great bar and restaurant scene, this place only solidifies that acclaim even more.",
March 16 at 12:17pm,"I am never ever disappointed at the Barrington Steakhouse and Oyster Bar (lounge) and last night was no exception!  Wonderful evening of delicious food, wine, lovely entertainment (Moe!) and, as always, delightful service.  So happy to have met Chef Alexandre and thank him for all his scrumptious creations.  The seared tuna is my favourite appie and that lamb shank...oh my Lord.  Also the pot de creme au chocolat and those lovely homemade donuts.  Yummy.  It was the first time I didn't actually have oysters and steak and I was still thoroughly impressed. This is where I bring all my special peeps. So, see you soon Barrington friends!",
February 15,Dinner was excellent and hands down the. Eat steak in the whole city. The drink selection is perfect along with the service. I have not had better in the city. This is the place if you want to have the best steak in Halifax or just a lovely evening with your loved one.,
March 5 at 9:58am,"Great sommelier. The sommelier here really knows her stuff. She hand-picked the wine for our social, and it was fantastic. Service is great and the food was incredible, and they even went out of their way to accommodate my husband's (previously unannounced) celiac needs. We were here for a social work function and were very impressed. We will be back.",
"December 8, 2017","Went last night for the first time with a colleague and the place is beautiful, very nice ambiance, the waiter was excellent along with the food, the steak was excellent as well...Little pricey for my budget but very nice treat!!",
February 17,"Traditionally my wife and I were ‘Keg’ people.  Then we went to this place!  All I can say is wow, this place is amazing.  Do yourself a favour and go, you won’t be disappointed!",
"November 18, 2017","Went in September for an anniversary supper. The service was great. I was disappointed with the food, the calamari was all different sizes which meant some we're quite overcooked and chewy. My husband had the burger which he did not enjoy, said he could have gotten a tastier burger from a local pub. I had a steak, the piece I received was more fat then meat, the double baked loaded potato was the best part of the meal, but when I got the rest of my meal to go they only packed up my steak and threw out the potato (which was extra) and my veggies. Let's just say I wasn't happy when I got home and saw this. Emailed with my experience never received a response.",
"November 5, 2017","There was a sign outside advertising $10 burgers for charity. We were walking by and were looking for a bite to eat so we went in. This was at 6:30 pm. We were seated in the bar area. It took way too long for a server to take our drink order. Then we were informed by the waiter that the $10 burger deal was only from 11-4. This was not stipulated on the sign. The server said he would see what he could do. Well, apparently he could do nothing. So, we finished our overpriced glass of wine and went to another establishment where we had more wine and burgers. Very disappointing experience. I will not be back.",
January 19,Absolutely loved this place. The ambiance was great. Enjoyed the Gahan PEI beer on tap with fantastic oysters and a beautiful Chicago rare ribeye. Spot on service as well.,
February 27 at 2:35pm,Better than Joe Beef in Montreal... My partner and I eat here almost every week now. Servers are awesome and the food is perfection!!,
March 9 at 10:54pm,The wagyu steak was the best beef I have ever had....wonderful atmosphere and beautiful surroundings.,
January 28,Fantastic service and meal. Loved the atmosphere and piano bar downstairs as well. I will be back.,
March 17 at 9:48pm,The service is great the food and amazing my favourite place to go out for steak  and oysters,
"July 22, 2017","If I could give the place 6 stars, I would.  For me, it is hands down the best restaurant in Halifax right now! We've been three times in the last month alone and  the entire experience was on point every occasion. #WhenYoureTheBestEST #BarNone",
"April 16, 2017","My photo studio is two doors down, so we've been neighbours since they opened. I would like to single you guys out for something that may go unnoticed: When you were doing the work to get the restaurant ready I noticed a door opener button and that the entrance was redone with a gentle slope to get in. I use a manual wheelchair, and I notice these things.... When I finally got here to eat tonight, I was very happy to find you have installed a modern lift between floors. Many businesses won't go as far as you have because they think ""all that money for only a few people"". The fact is, everyone can and will use a door opener and the lift. You did this right! And the service and food were really great. I had the scallops for my app and the bourbob steak for my main, done rare. Everything was perfectly cooked. I am a happy fella. Welcome to the neighbourhood. It was very nice to meet you. Paul",
February 11,Amazing meal and service. 20oz Rib eye was the best steak I have ever had. Worth every penny.,
January 1,"Went for New Year's Eve. Fantastic service, great atmosphere, live entertainment and best steak I've ever had anywhere. Can't wait to go back.",
"August 19, 2017","It was my first time there last night  , a business meeting as it were .  I've eaten steaks and oysters all over North America, I've got to say the food ,staff and the entire atmosphere in your establishment was excellent !!  I plan on many return visits!  WELL DONE !!",
"July 9, 2017","We visited The Barrington for the second time, last night. Like the first time, it was fantastic! I had the tuna and my husband had the steak bread, as appetizers. We both had steak, cooked perfectly as our mains with a side of mac n cheese (I could go there and just eat the mac n cheese, it was that good). We had a great table and Jason was a fantastic server. We were so full we couldn't eat dessert, so we took a bag of donuts to go! Overall, a great night! Thank you.",
February 15,Lovely atmosphere and great service.  Meal was amazing!  Can't wait to go back.,
"May 14, 2017","Best lobster mac and cheese I have ever had, great dill potatoes and good service. Loved the unique cocktails!  The seafood tower was ok, could have used more dressings for the seafood and the crab legs were not sliced in halves, making them hard to eat.  Overall we were impressed and will be back :)",
"March 26, 2017","Went to the Barrington Steakhouse last night for a pre Matt Good show dinner. AMAZING! The service was fantastic. Mavi was by far the best waitress I have ever had - seriously, she's hilarious and we all wanted to steal her from work to come party with us for the night. The atmosphere was wonderful, the champagne great and the food - unbelievable. I usually phone prior to going out (esp to a steakhouse) to let them know I am vegan and if they can accommodate. Given our timing..., I didn't (was also prepared to grab a falafel wrap if they couldn't). It was no sweat to the team when I told them and the chef delivered one of the best meals I have eaten at a restaurant. I am used to getting the least creative meal at places like this (meat & seafood heavy menus) and this was by far not that. I was beyond satisfied! There was not one complaint from our table as the entire group raved about how fantastic it was. Thank you! I can't wait to go again.",
"June 17, 2017","Had a late lunch on the sheltered patio. Service was great. They were accommodating with our small baby. Food was excellent we had the rib eye, ceaser salad and fries. Steak was flavorful and cooked properly(medium rare). Desert consisted of creme brulet and terimissu.",
"February 12, 2017","Went here for the first time last night after hearing lots of good things about it. Needless to say, we were not disappointed. Lovely upbeat atmosphere with good popular music playing. It was lovely, the wait staff were prompt and knowledgeable and the food was fantastic!  We had the Seafood bruschetta to start and it was amazing! Scallop and huge shrimps in a delicious sauce over crispy toast. I also had a couple NS oysters with their homemade cocktail sauce. I can't wait to go back just for those! For our main, we shared the 30oz Cote de Boeuf which was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. Came with mashed potatoes and fries that were drizzled in a sour cream and balsamic sauce, as well as lovely golden beats, green beans and roasted cauliflower. Amazing experience, can't wait to go back!",
"June 14, 2017","Fantastic environment and atmosphere. The staff made us feel welcomed, while maintaining a professional and classy approach. Our waiter recommended the perfect steak and wine combo, with the steak cooked perfectly and bursting with flavour. Plating and presentation were phenomenal, and the wait was surprisingly short for how busy they were. Unbelievable whiskey selection, and despite having a broad range of cocktails to choose from, they made one off-menu for my girlfriend that she loved. It wasn't even as pricey as I was expecting, but worth every penny. My only regret was not coming back for breakfast.",
"July 7, 2017","This was the best food I have ever had. The staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming and knowledgable about the menu. The atmosphere makes you never want to leave. 5 stars are not enough",
"December 18, 2016","Back in June, we wanted to experience this restaurant for my birthday, unfortunately we had to cancel. Well we finally made it last night. Although the weather was messy, the effort our party made getting there was well worth the trip!  Our waitress was knowledgable, friendly and engaging. Our meal was fantastic, with the Chateaubriand cooked perfectly! Oysters were simply the very best. The decor is first class and creative. If you're looking for a 5 star experience, visit the Barrington Oyster Bar & Steak house. Already planning our next visit!  Thanks everyone.",

Pedi o Seafood Tower e acertei em cheio, pois veio com ostras, camarões, mexilhões e caranguejo! Um vinho da Nova Schotia completou a festa! I'm sure it was the best lobster I've had in my life! Fresquissima, well prepared and tasty! I ordered the seafood tower, and I got it right, because it came with oysters, shrimp, mussels and crab! A new wine has completed the party!",

"October 26, 2016","I went here for the first time this summer and the whole experience was absolutely amazing. My coworkers and I stopped in for an after work drink, had beautiful cocktails and some yummy appetizers. It was also my first time trying oysters and I am so glad that this is where it happened. The knowledge of the staff, the service, the atmosphere, the food and drink, everything was top notch. We also had charcuterie and the calamari, and it could easily be voted top in the city. I felt completely revitalized after my experience here. Five stars all the way! Go to the Barrington Steakhouse!",
"October 24, 2016","I was celebrating my 55th birthday when I got to experience this restaurant. I have to admit all 5 people in our group were very impressed with the preparation, presentation and portion sizes of our meals.

"September 6, 2016","Stumbled upon this gem recently looking for a place to celebrate our 9th wedding anniversary.  Hubby and I are carnivores and love a good steak. A few years ago we had the best steaks of our lives in a high-end steakhouse in Toronto.  Sorry Toronto, you've been downgraded. The new best steaks of our lives happened right here in our hometown of Halifax at The Barrington Steakhouse & Oyster Bar.  The decor is stunning. The staff were all friendly, knowledgeable.  The food was absolutely AMAZING!  Every dish was prepared to perfection. The quality and quantity was worth every penny!  Well done.",

"June 17, 2016",Always hesitant when visiting a place that has only been open for a short time but gave it a try...needless to say it did not disappoint. Great service from the welcome at the front door to the thanks for coming on the way out. Prices on the high end but selection and quality easily justify the cost. Will definitely return to explore more of the menu...wine and food,
"June 5, 2016",Fantastic steak and delicious oysters. Soon to be a Halifax icon!,
"June 3, 2016","We had a great time! We are really looking forward to going back to try more items on the menu and checking out their entertainment. Especially the piano. The decor was beautiful cozy but well lit and spacious. The fireplace will be amazing in the winter. Our waiter, Nick, was knowledgeable about the menu. He took great care to ensure our time there was a special experience. I especially liked that Nick kept our table clean, and stocked with fresh silverware through our courses. The meal was sooooo good! So good we have to back to try the desert menu. My only recommendation would be to have an alternative to the air hand dryer in the washroom. Highly recommend this place. Great addition to downtown",
