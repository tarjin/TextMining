"November 13, 2017",No more country music. Super long coat check line. Bartenders with no customer service skills. This used to be one of my favourite bars to go to when I visit Halifax but I won't be back.,
March 4 at 3:12am,"Always had fun at this place until tonight when I encountered a racist bouncer who wouldn’t let me in after I waited 30 mins in line, kept pushing me, I reported to the manager and did nothing. Never going back.",
"September 3, 2017","This was the final stop on a friends bachlorette,  we spent the last 3 hours of the night there. Great music and bar staff. Never waited more than a few mins at a door or the bar. Hadn't  been downtown in years and can definately see a return visit soon.",
January 26,No more country night :( Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,
"September 12, 2016","Far more positive than the Argyle. For the Dance Floor was big enough to handle my moves. The people behind the bar were absolute professionals. The drinks were enjoyable. I was happy that the security was not in the way, rather just standing tall, watching for any trouble. Gladly there was no trouble. The seats were very comfortable to sit in when I needed a break from the dance floor. One thing, the exit stairs should have handrails on BOTH sides, wait maybe they did, but I can't remember. Ok, another thing. If it was possible, install a window in the washroom. Would help people get a bit of fresh air without having to walk down the stairs and back up again.",
"November 13, 2017","Its a nightclub, busy and a little rowdy but a great time!",
"April 19, 2017","Went for St Patrick's Day and the DJ played a great variety of music and kept the dance floor packed all night. Normally it is a country bar, so I don't frequent it regularly.",
"May 29, 2016",Phenomenal staff and great spot f you want top 40. DJ was on point.  I highly recommend this bar.,
"August 30, 2016","The bartenders gravitate towards people they know/that have tipped them well, and will pass you over all night until you leave if you don't do the same. Seriously.",
"September 24, 2017",What a buzz kill !!!!!!!!! Never returning!!!!!!!!!!,
"March 5, 2016",Drug dealers inside a bar working with a mostly ignorant staff (except the guy at the front door that night). Avoid if your can while in Halifax. It will ruin any good experience you might have and there are so many other great places on that same street.,
"June 24, 2017",No more country nights aka no more frequenting toothy ����,
"December 29, 2016","love the Goofy Moose comedy!  Great times, good fun and fantastic laughs... even if someone wants your pants",
"June 19, 2016",Had a good night last night and then the bouncers took some guys side because he was a local. They then got hold of me by my neck and took me out but I suggest you get some now security as them guys can't do shit gang of pussys!,
"January 18, 2015","Friday night, all Country night is awesome, especially when they have the video show!  My favourite bar in Halifax!",
